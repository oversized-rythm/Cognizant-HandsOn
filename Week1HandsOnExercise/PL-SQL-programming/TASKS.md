# WEEK 01 : PL/SQL Programming

<hr>

## Exercise 1: Control Structures

### Scenario 1: The bank wants to apply a discount to loan interest rates for customers above 60 years old.
-  Write a PL/SQL block that loops through all customers, checks their age, and if they are above 60, apply a
1% discount to their current loan interest rates.

### Scenario 2: A customer can be promoted to VIP status based on their balance.
- Write a PL/SQL block that iterates through all customers and sets a flag IsVIP to TRUE for those with a
balance over $10,000.
<blockquote>
The provided schema does not include an IsVIP column in the Customers table. To implement Scenario 2 as specified, an additional IsVIP column (CHAR(1) or BOOLEAN, depending on the database) must be added. Age is calculated dynamically using the DOB column.
</blockquote>

### Scenario 3: The bank wants to send reminders to customers whose loans are due within the next 30 days.
-  Write a PL/SQL block that fetches all loans due in the next 30 days and prints a reminder message for each
customer.

## Exercise 3: Stored Procedures

### Scenario 1: The bank needs to process monthly interest for all savings accounts.
- Write a stored procedure ProcessMonthlyInterest that calculates and updates the balance of all savings accounts by applying an interest rate of 1% to the current balance.

### Scenario 2: The bank wants to implement a bonus scheme for employees based on their performance.
- Write a stored procedure UpdateEmployeeBonus that updates the salary of employees in a given department by adding a bonus percentage passed as a parameter.

### Scenario 3: Customers should be able to transfer funds between their accounts.
- Write a stored procedure TransferFunds that transfers a specified amount from one account to another, checking that the source account has sufficient balance before making the transfer.
